New movie recommendation:
Whenever  a  new  item  enters  the  database  on  top  of  which  the  recommendation system runs, there is no rating hence we feel hard to recommend this item to users via cosine similarity algorithm.  We should have enough amount of ratings so that we can recommend it to users.[Ban], there is one method that we can first make use of tags and tf-idf to calculate the cosine similarity between the new item and the current items in database (tags examples:   action,  love,  horror,  drama  and  so  on).   Then  we  provide  a  possible rating of the new item for all user according to the current rating set.  The top k (in the code I choose k to be 100).  Wait until the non-rated movie has rating, we can add this item into the previous rating set to calculate its items cosine similarity.
